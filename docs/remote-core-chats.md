# Remote Herdr 2 native chats

Owner: `feat/h2r3-remote-chats`. This is implementation and acceptance evidence,
not a claim that all runtime/platform checks have passed.

## Routing and ownership

- `chat/core_pane.rs` discovers ACP endpoint labels in driven core tabs on
  their owning host. Local keys stay `core:t1`; remote keys include a
  length-delimited saved host scope. `Surface::RemoteCore` retains the typed
  host and terminal separately from the display key.
- `core_terminals/hosts.rs` reads each host's own terminal metadata. A remote
  `t1` never borrows the local `t1`'s cwd, foreground process, or tab. Mirrors
  neither split nor display an interactive chat. Normal split/zoom layout and
  native composer focus apply to remote panes.
- A remote launch executes the existing `remote_program_script` lookup on
  that host, with the endpoint environment and terminal label chosen together.
  The existing core start queue supplies the remote cwd and tab/workspace
  association. A kept workspace without a driven tab starts a new core tab.
- SSH attach uses the existing `sheprd-acp connect ENDPOINT` stream. Cloud
  and WSL use `chat/remote_route.rs`: provider credentials remain alive for
  the entire stream; WSL uses the system WSL executable and the selected
  distribution's shell. Endpoint IDs are validated, never treated as paths.
- Changing/removing the saved host invalidates discovery against metadata
  from its former connection. Process-less metadata, recovered shells, lost
  terminals, and core-forwarded `other/t1` terminals are not chat endpoints.
- Prompts, permission answers, cancellation, bounded queues, cursor resume,
  and command deduplication use the existing chat session/link protocol.
  Dropping a link cancels connector preparation and closes its exact child.
  This transport never launches recovery when a stream drops.

## Conversion and recovery dependencies

Remote conversion runs `sheprd-acp session-convert TERMINAL AGENT` on the
owning host, with `SHEPRD_EXPECT_CORE` set to the connected core's ID and
inherited core selection variables cleared. The helper validates that core
before discovery or mutation. Its session discovery belongs to #1285; see
[agent session evidence](agent-session-evidence.md) for supported reporters
and limitations. Conversion is cancelled if the saved target or core changes,
and is never automatically replayed after a transport failure.

Recovery records, ownership claims, explicit restore, and expected-close
handling belong to the chat-restore slice (#1280). Remote launch uses the
host core's injected `HC_TERMINAL_ID` and `HC_TERMINAL_SOCKET`; it neither
copies records to the desktop nor starts a second agent to reconnect a view.
Automatic process-loss/reboot recovery is not proven by these attach changes.

## Acceptance evidence

| Area | Regression coverage | Runtime status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host-scoped identities | `chat/core_pane/tests/identity.rs`, `tests/remote.rs` | Rust execution pending CI |
| Remote split/visibility and mirror refusal | `core_terminals/tests/chats/remote.rs` | Rust execution pending CI |
| Native focus, host removal, prompt/answer/cancel routing | `chat/tests/core_panes/remote.rs` (headless, mock peer) | Pending CI; not native desktop proof |
| Endpoint validation and recovered-shell exclusion | `chat/core_pane/tests/remote.rs` | Pending CI |
| Connector cancellation, invalid targets, no local fallback | `chat/remote_route/tests.rs` | Pending CI; WSL runtime requires Windows |
| Owning-core conversion fence | `chat/convert/remote/tests.rs` and #1285 helper tests | Pending CI and remote agent smoke tests |

Manual acceptance still required: start each supported agent on saved SSH,
cloud and WSL hosts with no Herdr 1; submit prompts and permission answers;
hide/show and resize narrow split panes; disconnect/reconnect without duplicate
turns; switch/edit/remove hosts with identical terminal IDs; close/reopen the
desktop; verify explicit recovery and intentional closure against #1280.
Native screenshots must come from the built application on a coordinated
desktop, not a headless rendering fixture.

Prerequisites and limitations: the host needs its own ACP and agent binaries.
The route requires POSIX `/bin/sh`; native Windows SSH shells without it are
unsupported. WSL execution is Windows-only. Non-Claude conversion requires
the exact process-bound evidence supported by #1285, not guessed session IDs.
Phone conversion and standalone layout are separate owned slices. Remote
attachments consume the file-images transfer foundation; native Windows
SSH/cloud uploads retain its existing explicit unsupported result.
