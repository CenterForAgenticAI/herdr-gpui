//! Sub-agents of agents that speak ACP directly, which ACP has no word for.
//! Copilot's and OpenCode's show as a tool call whose input names the agent
//! and its prompt. OpenCode also sends the child session's own updates on the
//! parent session, each marked in `_meta`. This goes by input neither agent
//! promises to keep, so a bridge's tag always wins over it.
//!
//! Only a sub-agent the call waits for is followed: one sent to the
//! background returns at once, and its end cannot be known on this path, so
//! it stays an ordinary card rather than an activity that never ends. Nothing
//! here can stop one, as ACP has no request for it.
