//! Terminals that herdr-core (Herdr 2) runs, shown as tabs in the window's
//! groups beside its Herdr tabs and pages. herdr-core streams raw output, so
//! the app emulates each one and paints it with the same painter as a Herdr
//! pane. A tab splits into panes the app lays out itself, drawn in the style
//! of the window's tab layout; any group can show one too, so terminals also
//! sit side by side across groups.
//!
//! Everything that waits runs off the UI thread: the hub connects (and may
//! start the bundled core), each shown pane has a worker that owns its
//! `sheprd_backend::Terminal`, and terminal details are listed on a thread.
//! The window reads their mailboxes on its tick and renders the prepared
//! screens.
