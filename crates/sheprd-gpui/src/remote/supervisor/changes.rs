//! The supervisor's part in answering phones about workspaces: while a phone
//! is connected it waits on the daemon for their questions, one long request
//! at a time, the next tick starting the next, and answers each on the
//! background executor. With no phone connected it asks nothing. A phone's
//! split or zoom of a Herdr 2 tab arrives the same way, and the window that
//! holds the tab makes it at once.
//!
//! The daemon's limit counts only questions a phone still waits for, and an
//! answer keeps running after its phone gives up, so the answers running here
//! are limited too; questions taken beyond that wait their turn here. Taking
//! goes on meanwhile, so a split or zoom, which needs no answer worked out,
//! does not wait behind slow workspace answers. A phone that gives up frees
//! its place at the daemon but not here, so taking stops once `QUEUED`
//! questions wait here.
