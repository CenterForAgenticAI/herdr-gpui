//! Moving a terminal agent into a chat: same pane, same conversation. The
//! agent's own CLI stops, and `sheprd-acp --resume` continues its session in
//! the shell it leaves behind. This is the policy the app and the remote
//! control daemon share; each asks Herdr in its own way and types the line.
//!
//! Only an idle agent moves: stopping one mid-turn would lose the turn.
//! Everything that could refuse is checked before the agent is touched, so
//! a refusal leaves it running. A CLI stops on Ctrl+C alone, which every
//! agent here takes as "clear the draft" and then "quit". A signal is not
//! used because Codex dies on SIGTERM with its terminal modes still set, and
//! the line typed next would reach the shell in the wrong keyboard mode; a
//! typed `/exit` is not used because a draft would be sent with it.
